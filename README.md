## Drools Stateless Sessions - Common Use Cases
- Validation
    - Is this passport valid?
    - Is this person eligible for a visa?
- Calculation
    Compute price of travel insurance
- Routing and Filtering

## Stateless vs Stateful Session
- Stateless in Drools means that you:
    - set the state (gather the data)
    - run the rule on this data
    - get the output
    - and then you are done
- With stateful sessions:
    - you can run rules multiple times without re-entering the data into the session
    - for example, you let the rules run every 5 minutes
